<b>Instructions</b><br><br>
We developed a computer vision system, called Machine <b>M</b>, that was trained to detect and locate human body parts in any given image. In the current experiment, you will first go through a <b>familiarization stage</b> and then a <b>testing stage</b>. First, in the familiarization stage, you will observe 5 sample images and evaluations on the machine <b>M</b>'s corresponding performance. Your task is to understand what the machine <b>M</b> <b>can</b> or <b>cannot</b> do. Then, in the testing stage, we will ask questions to test your understanding of the machine <b>M</b>'s behavior. <br /> <br />

<!-- We have a visual recognition machine 'M' (i.e M is a computer vision system) that predicts locations of human body parts, poses and actions in any given image I. The goal of this experiment is to let you observe the machine's behavior on several images and then we test your understanding of the machine's behavior. Specifically, the experiment consists of two phases namely, Familiarization Phase and Testing Phase. <br /> <br /> -->
<b>(a) Familiarization Stage</b>: In the familiarization stage, we will show you images that were provided to the machine <b>M</b>. The images contain one human figure with the entire body. <br><br>

You will see the machine <b>M</b>'s performance on detecting and locating human body parts of the human in these images. For some images, the machine <b>M</b> is able to accurately detect and locate human body parts. However, in other images, the machine <b>M</b> may not be able to accurately detect or locate human body parts. <br> <br/ >

You are expected to observe the machine <b>M</b>'s performance and understand its behavior (e.g. how the machine <b>M</b> functions and what it can or cannot do). For each trial, you will be given 45 seconds to observe the machine <b>M</b>'s behavior. Please patiently view the provided information and pay attention during the whole 45 seconds. It will automatically move on to the next trial after 45 seconds.<br><br>
<!-- In the familiarization stage, we will show you images along with machine M's prediction of human body parts/activity on the images. You are expected to observe and understand the Machine behavior, i.e, you may identify cases where Machine is able to predict correct answers, and the cases where Machine fails to predict correct answers. igure 1 below  -->

<!-- Note that you will be given about 45 seconds to observe machine's output on each image. <br> <br> -->

<b>(b) Testing Stage</b>: After you finish the familiarization stage, we will test your understanding of the machine <b>M</b>'s behavior. We will show you a new set of images and tasks and ask several questions such as "Will the machine <b>M</b> correctly solve the task?", "What would be the output of the machine <b>M</b>", etc. Please choose your answers based on your understanding of the machine <b>M</b>'s behavior.<br> <br>

<!-- After you finish the training phase, we will test your understanding of the Machine. We will show you a new set of images/tasks and ask several questions such as "Will the Machine correctly solve the task?", "What would be the output of the Machine", etc.<br><br> -->
